# NOSQL Social Network App


## Description

This application is a Social Networking Application.  It is a forum for users to post thoughts, reactions to thoughts, and create friendships.  Through building this project, I learned to use MongoDB as a database program.  I also learned how to use Mongoose to interact with MongoDB, allowing me to create schemas and models to be enforced by the application, among other useful functionality.  This project gave me familarity with the structure of embedded documents and referenced documents, and allowed me to practice working with building CRUD operations which work well with both of these types of relationships between documents.

## Installation

To install this application, you will need to run "npm install" in node, which will install the dependencies for this project.  Then, you can run "npm start" to run the server, and open http://localhost:3001/ in Insomnia.  

## Usage

Once you have installed the application's dependencies and started the server, you can make HTTP requests to the site's routes to add new users, thoughts, reactions, and friendships to the site's database.
